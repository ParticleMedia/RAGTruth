# RAGTruth
![](image/fig1.jpg)

RAGTruth is a word-level hallucination corpus in various tasks within the Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setting both for **training** and **evaluating**.

RAG has become a main technique for alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual cases and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity.

## Updates
1. [2024/02] We updated the data: we included more annotated hallucinations and added one new meta, `implicit_true`.
2. [2024/01] We released the RAGTruth corpus.
## Dataset
Given that each piece of source information elicits six distinct responses from various Language Models, we publish the source information and its corresponding responses individually.

1. **response.jsonl**

| Field Name  | Field Value | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| id          | String       | The index of the response.                |
| source_id         | String     | The index of the source information.  |
| model   | String      | The model that generates the response.  |
| temperature           | Float      | The temperature when generating response.          |
| labels           |List[Dict]      | The hallucination spans. `text` is the hallucination itself; `start` & `end` are the position of hallucination span in the response; `label_type` is the type of the hallucination span. `due_to_null` means whether the hallucination is caused by null value. `implicit_true` means this span is correct while the info is not mentioned in the context. `meta` is the comment of the hallucination given by annotators.      |
| split           | String      |  `train` or `test`           |
| quality          | String      | Indicate whether this answer has quality issues. `incorrect_refusal` means the model mistakenly refuses to answer despite the presence of the relevant context. `truncated` means the response is truncated unexpectedly.    |
| response      | String      | The response of LLMs given a certain instruction.  |

Sample:
```json
{
  "id": "1472",
  "source_id": "11316",
  "model": "mistral-7B-instruct",
  "temperature": 0.925,
  "labels": [
    {
      "start": 219,
      "end": 229,
      "text": "Gaza Strip",
      "meta": "HIGH INTRO OF NEW INFO\nIt is not mentioned in the original source that Gaza Strip is included in the occupied Palestinian territory.",
      "label_type": "Evident Baseless Info"
    }
  ],
  "split": "train",
  "quality": "good",
  "response": "The Palestinian Authority has officially become the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. This includes East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, which are occupied by Israel. The signing of Rome Statute by Palestinians in January 2021 had already established ICC's jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"since June 13, 2014\" in these areas. Now, the court can open a preliminary investigation or formal investigation into the situation in Palestinian territories, potentially leading to war crimes probes against Israeli individuals. However, this could also lead to counter-charges against Palestinians. The ICC welcomed Palestine's accession, while Israel and the US, who are not ICC members, opposed the move."
}

2. **source_info.jsonl**

| Field Name  | Field Value | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| source_id         | String     | The index of the source information.  |
| task_type           | String      | The task type of the data, including QA, Data2txt and Summary         |
| source | String      |  The source of the original content.    |
| source_info | String or Dict     | Base content under RAG setting. For summarization tasks, the value of this field is of the string type; for data-to-text and QA (question-answering) tasks, the value of this field is of the dict type.    |
| prompt | String | The prompt we used to generate responses. For Llama and Mistral models, we used `<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]`. |

The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based.

As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court's decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead.
